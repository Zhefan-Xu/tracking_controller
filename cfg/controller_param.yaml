# Controller Tunning Guide
# 1. Get the correct hover throttle (most important)
# 2. Start with P control for both position and velocity. Start with smaller value (increase no more than 20%)
# 3. If z direction position has steady-state error, give a little p_i.
# 4. I don't think it is necessary to use position d and velocity i and d.

body_rate_control: false # all parameters

# Position PID

position_p: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5]
position_i: [0.0, 0.0, 0.1]
position_d: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# Velocity
velocity_p: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
velocity_i: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
velocity_d: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# Body rate control 
attitude_control_tau: 0.3 # (this will not be used if attitude control is true)
hover_thrust: 0.70 # this need to be very accurate for a good control (most important)
